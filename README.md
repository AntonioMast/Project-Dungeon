# ProjectDungeon: A Task in Creating Engaging A.I. Opponents in Games
Project Dungeon is a Unity Game with the primary purpose of creating an engaging A.I. Opponent.
The games lets the player design and create a 'dungeon', or level, and fight an  A.I. opponent as it attempts to traverse the dungeon.

There are two main game states that player will have fun exploring:

The Design State - This state revolves around designing a dungeon using premade map pieces. The player can make winding hallways, looping paths, and more!

The Play State - Designing a dungeon wouldn't be any fun if there was nothing to do! This state revolves around defeating the A.I. opponent as it navigates your dungeon.
Here, you will carefully manage your currency and buy spawnable minions that try to stop the A.I. opponent. No minion is strong on it's own, but together with more minions?
Then maybe you will stand a chance at stopping the hero.

# Instructions
As Project Dungeon is a Unity game, the project contains a strict file structure which I am unable to change too greatly.
The Assets folder contains everything that I created, edited, or implemented directly.
If you would just like to read the code that I wrote for this project, then navigate to the ".../Assets/Scripts" directory to see the C# scripts that make the game work!
Want to open the game in the Unity editor? Just clone the project and open the unzipped file in the editor as a new project.

Just want to play? Than head to releases and follow the instruction in the newest release! https://github.com/AntonioMast/ProjectDungeon/releases
