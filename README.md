# ProjectDungeon: A Task in Creating Engaging A.I. Opponents in Games
Project Dungeon is a Unity Game with the primary purpose of creating an engaging A.I. Opponent.
This game lets players design and create their own dungeon level on which they will fight an  A.I. "hero" opponent as it navigates the dungeon in an attempt to find the exit.

There are two main game states for players to enjoy:

The Design State - This state revolves around designing a dungeon using premade map pieces. Players can make winding hallways, looping paths, and whatever else they can imagine!

The Play State - Designing a dungeon wouldn't be nearly as fun if there was nothing to do with it! The Play State revolves around creating traps and monsters in order to defeat the A.I. hero opponent as it navigates through your dungeon in real time. Players will need to carefully manage their currency as they place their traps, however. As with everything else in life, nothing is really free.
